# HubFramework_Swift_demo1

I have tried to replicate the example given in "https://spotify.github.io/HubFramework/getting-started-guide.html" under the original HUBFramework repositery 
in addition have some of my own components & implementations like: <br />

#####1) How to design a component[Banner] using XIB interface & use it as a widget in the component file[ComponentBanner]. <br />
#####2) How to use local image as an image resource for your component in the [ComponentBanner] whereas the image was given to the MODEL in the [CitiesContentOperation] @the end.

Want to use my project?? <br />
```
git clone https://github.com/anantthebiker/HubFramework_Swift_demo1.git
